• What does fast-forward in git mean?
- When you try to merge one commit with a commit that can be reached by following the first 
commit’s history, Git simplifies things by moving the pointer forward because there is no 
divergent work to merge together – this is called a “fast-forward.”

• Why should you have different branches?
- We have different branches to have code segregation when more than one person is working on 
same project. People can push particular changes or features in their own branch and later merge 
it with the main branch.

• In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
- Normally in a project we have 3 .
